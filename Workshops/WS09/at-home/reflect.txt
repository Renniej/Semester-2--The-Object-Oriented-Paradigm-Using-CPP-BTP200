1. Since the program only compiles template functions when called on it can not be put into a cpp file for 
pre-compliation. Instead it must be declared and defined in the header file.


2.  The template function only works when it is put below main as it only compiles when it is alled.

3. Yes, you could but you would be copy and pasting code at that point and that s always a bad practice. 
	Templates allow for you to hae the same logic and still use differnt types of data.

4. Yes, both are interchangable except in specific cases.
