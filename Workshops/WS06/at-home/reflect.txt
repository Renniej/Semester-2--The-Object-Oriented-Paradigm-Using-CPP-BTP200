Note: I talked to you during wednesday class if I could hand in this assignment on thursday(11:59pm) via
my accomedations. 


1) If your copy operator does a shallow copy of dynamically allocated resources then one of the
   resources may end up being deallocated due to one of the objects going out of scope.   
	This behaviour can lead to unpredictable behaviour from your program.

2)  If you find yourself duplicating code then it may be better to just create a function with that code.

3)  That in most circumstances it is best to deep copy.  Also making my code more modulated from the in-lab part
made that at home part much more easier as I barely wrote any new code.   This realization will probably help me a lot
in the future. 



Quiz Reflection:

I was not able to get quiz 5 back.
