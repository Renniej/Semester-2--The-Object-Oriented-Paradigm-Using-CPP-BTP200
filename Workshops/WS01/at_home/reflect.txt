1. namespace is a method used to provide a scope to varibles, functions, etc. It is usually used for organization purposes especially when working in groups.
A common problem it stops is name issues when mutiple headers have idenitifers with identical names. 


2. A header file contains declariations of identifiers that you want to share across a multiude of seperate code files. 

3. Header files are already taken care of in the preprocessing stage of compliation. trying to compile them directly will most likely lead to error

4. Because what's the point of seperating these into modules if you're just going to include the cpp. During preprocessing it will just be like
you coded it all in one big file and that can lead to very big compile times if you're working on a big program.

5. I never used compliation safe-guards in the past because I assumed the compiler handled this automatically.  I learnt that this assumption was very very wrong. 
  I also learnt that my big project I worked on in grade 12 could of benefitted if I thought a bit more about modularity.
